A MERN stack task management system web application that allows users to efficiently manage tasks. The application supports two roles: admin and user. The admin role has access to all user data and can gain insights from the admin dashboard. A normal user can create tasks, assign them to other users in the database, and update task data and status. This full stack application provides dynamic functionality for seamless task management. 🚀
